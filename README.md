## What?

I'm mostly writing this as an opportunity to teach myself Rust, but I think it
could also be useful for automated tracking of the astrophysics literature,
since Rust tends to be a pretty good language for writing command line utilities.

If you're not interested in using Rust, check out the [`ads` Python
package](https://github.com/andycasey/ads).

## How?
